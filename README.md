## Description
The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game implemented in Python. The goal of the game is to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters within a limited number of attempts. This project serves as an opportunity to reinforce programming principles such as loops, conditions, functions, and object-oriented programming (OOP) concepts.

## Installation
To use the Hangman Game, the following requirements must be met:

- Python 3.x installed on your machine.

1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the following command to start the game:

## Usage
1. Upon running the game, you will be presented with a blank word representing the hidden word to be guessed and the number of remaining attempts.
2. Guess a letter by entering it in the terminal.
3. If the letter is present in the word, it will be revealed in the corresponding positions. Otherwise, the number of remaining attempts will decrease.
4. Continue guessing letters until you guess the entire word correctly or run out of attempts.
5. The game will end when you either win by guessing the word correctly, lose by running out of attempts or if you enter quit.

## Timeline
The project took approximately 6-7 hours to complete, including the design, implementation, and testing phases. It was developed as part of the AI Bootcamp at BeCode.org, with the aim of strengthening Python syntax and applying programming principles.

## Personal Situation
This project was undertaken as part of the AI Bootcamp at BeCode.org. The bootcamp provides a comprehensive learning experience in AI concepts and programming. The Hangman Game project was a practical exercise to reinforce programming skills and showcase the application of basic principles and OOP concepts.
